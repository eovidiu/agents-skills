# Frontend Reviewer Skill

## Overview

This skill provides systematic frontend code review capabilities across React, Vue, Angular, HTML/CSS, accessibility (a11y), and performance optimization. Reviews produce categorized checklists with specific findings, severity ratings, and actionable recommendations.

## Expertise
- React 19 patterns, hooks, and component composition
- TypeScript type safety, generics, and strict mode
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui component architecture (üé® Blue - UI/Design focus)
- State management: TanStack Query, React Hook Form
- Performance: useMemo, useCallback, React.memo, bundle optimization
- Accessibility: ARIA, Radix UI, keyboard navigation
- Data visualization: Recharts, Plotly, D3, ECharts, Highcharts
- Form validation: Zod, Yup, React Hook Form
- Build optimization: Vite configuration and chunking

## Review Workflow

Follow this workflow when conducting frontend code reviews:

### Step 1: Understand the Scope

Identify what needs to be reviewed:
- **PR/Commit Review**: Use git diff to see changed files
- **File Review**: Read specific files provided
- **Codebase Audit**: Scan relevant directories

Determine the primary framework (React/Vue/Angular) and note any special contexts (e.g., TypeScript, testing files, build configuration).

### Step 2: Load Relevant References

Based on the code being reviewed, load appropriate reference materials:

**For all reviews:**
- Read `references/common-issues.md` to identify known anti-patterns

**For deep reviews or when unfamiliar with specific patterns:**
- Read `references/best-practices.md` for comprehensive guidelines
- Focus on relevant sections (React/Vue/Angular, HTML/CSS, a11y, Performance)

### Step 3: Conduct the Review

Systematically examine the code across these categories:

#### Component Architecture (React/Vue/Angular)
- Single responsibility principle adherence
- Proper state management (local vs. global)
- Props/state handling patterns
- Hooks/composables usage (dependency arrays, cleanup, custom hooks)
- Component composition and reusability
- Lifecycle management
- Error boundaries (React) or error handling

#### HTML/CSS Structure
- Semantic HTML usage
- Form accessibility and validation
- CSS organization and methodology
- Responsive design implementation
- Modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties)
- Performance considerations (expensive properties, reflows)

#### Accessibility (a11y)
- **ARIA**: Proper usage, semantic HTML first, accessible names
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab order, focus management, focus indicators, custom control interactions
- **Screen readers**: Alt text, aria-live regions, form labels, error messages
- **Color and contrast**: WCAG compliance (4.5:1 minimum for normal text)
- **Focus management**: Modal focus traps, return focus patterns

#### Performance
- **Bundle size**: Code splitting, tree shaking, dependency optimization
- **Runtime performance**: Re-render optimization, virtualization, debouncing
- **Images and media**: Modern formats, responsive images, lazy loading, dimensions
- **Network**: HTTP requests, caching, prefetching
- **Metrics**: Core Web Vitals awareness (LCP, FID, CLS)

#### Security
- XSS prevention (input sanitization, avoiding dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- Dependency security (audit status)
- No exposed secrets or tokens

### Step 4: Generate Categorized Review Report

Structure findings in this format:

```markdown
# Frontend Code Review

## Summary
[Brief overview: X files reviewed, Y issues found across Z categories]

## üèóÔ∏è Component Architecture
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: [What's working well]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: [Non-critical issues with recommendations]
- ‚ùå **ISSUE**: [Critical problems requiring fixes]
  - Location: `file.tsx:42`
  - Problem: [Specific issue]
  - Fix: [Recommended solution]

## üé® HTML/CSS Structure
[Same format as above]

## ‚ôø Accessibility
[Same format as above]

## ‚ö° Performance
[Same format as above]

## üîí Security
[Same format as above]

## üìä Overall Assessment
[High-level summary and priority recommendations]
```

### Step 5: Prioritize Findings

Classify issues by severity:

**‚ùå CRITICAL** - Must fix before merge
- Accessibility blockers (no keyboard access, missing alt text on critical images)
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, exposed secrets)
- Broken functionality (missing dependencies, state mutation bugs)
- Severe performance issues (no code splitting for large routes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING** - Should fix soon
- Non-critical accessibility issues (low contrast on secondary text)
- Performance improvements (missing memoization, could use lazy loading)
- Code organization issues (prop drilling, large components)
- Minor anti-patterns (index as key in stable lists)

**‚úÖ PASS / üí° SUGGESTION** - Nice to have
- Style guide preferences
- Additional optimizations
- Refactoring opportunities

## Common Review Patterns

### React Component Review Checklist
- [ ] All hooks have correct dependency arrays
- [ ] Effects have cleanup functions where needed
- [ ] No direct state mutation
- [ ] Props properly validated (TypeScript interfaces)
- [ ] Memoization used appropriately (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Keys on list items are unique and stable
- [ ] No index as key (unless list is truly static)
- [ ] Error boundaries for error handling

### Accessibility Review Checklist
- [ ] All images have alt text (or alt="" if decorative)
- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] ARIA used correctly (semantic HTML first)
- [ ] Form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text)
- [ ] No reliance on color alone for information
- [ ] Custom controls implement proper keyboard patterns

### Performance Review Checklist
- [ ] Routes are code-split/lazy-loaded
- [ ] Heavy libraries are tree-shaken or replaced
- [ ] Images are optimized (WebP/AVIF, srcset, lazy loading)
- [ ] Long lists use virtualization
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Expensive computations memoized
- [ ] Bundle size is reasonable

## Tips for Effective Reviews

**Be Specific**
- Always include file path and line number (e.g., `components/Header.tsx:23`)
- Provide concrete code examples for fixes
- Reference specific guidelines from the references

**Be Constructive**
- Acknowledge what's done well
- Explain *why* something is an issue, not just *what*
- Offer alternatives and trade-offs

**Be Practical**
- Consider the context (MVP vs. production app)
- Prioritize critical issues over style preferences
- Balance perfectionism with shipping

**Be Educational**
- Link to relevant documentation
- Explain best practices being applied
- Help developers learn, not just fix
