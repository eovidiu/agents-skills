## Skills Overview

### Frontend Reviewer
Systematic code review for React, Vue, and Angular applications. Analyzes component architecture, HTML/CSS, accessibility (WCAG 2.1), and performance. Produces categorized checklists with severity ratings and actionable recommendations. Covers React 19 patterns, hooks, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, state management, and build optimization. Identifies anti-patterns with specific file/line references and concrete fixes.

### Fastify Expert
Senior-level expertise for high-performance Node.js applications with Fastify. Covers plugin architecture, schema-first development with JSON Schema/TypeBox, and performance engineering using autocannon and clinic.js. Includes production-ready boilerplate with database integration, authentication, Docker setup, and comprehensive testing. Provides detailed references for architecture, optimization, security, and deployment patterns.

### TDD UI Expert
Pragmatic Test-Driven Development for React applications using React Testing Library and MSW for API mocking. Emphasizes integration-first testing strategy and Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Covers testing components, forms, hooks, and authentication flows. Focuses on behavior-driven testingâ€”test what matters (business logic, workflows) while skipping what doesn't (CSS, styling). Includes templates and setup scripts.

### Web Accessibility Checker
Comprehensive accessibility compliance checker for WCAG 2.2 Level AA and European Accessibility Act (EAA) requirements. Provides automated testing with axe-core, manual testing procedures, and structured compliance reports. Covers keyboard navigation, screen reader testing, color contrast, and form accessibility.
